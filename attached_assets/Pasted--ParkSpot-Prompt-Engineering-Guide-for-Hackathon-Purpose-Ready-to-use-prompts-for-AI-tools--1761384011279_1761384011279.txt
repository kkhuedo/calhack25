2. Floating action button for "Report Parking"
3. Bottom sheet showing spot details when user taps marker
4. Report modal with two large buttons: "I Parked Here" and "I'm Leaving"

DESIGN STYLE:
- Minimalist, Uber/Lyft-like aesthetic
- Primary color: Blue (#2196F3)
- Confidence colors: Green (#4CAF50), Yellow (#FFC107), Red (#F44336)
- Sans-serif font (Roboto or SF Pro)
- High contrast for outdoor visibility

OUTPUT:
Provide Figma-style component descriptions, color palette hex codes, and spacing guidelines (in 8px increments)

```

**Prompt 2: Icon Design**

```
Design custom map marker icons for a parking app with these states:
1. Available spot (high confidence) - green pin
2. Available spot (medium confidence) - yellow pin
3. Occupied spot - red pin
4. Unknown/stale spot - gray pin with question mark
5. User location - blue dot with pulsing ring

Style: Minimalist, 32x32px, flat design, clearly distinguishable at small sizes
Provide SVG code or detailed description for implementation

```

**Prompt 3: User Flow Diagram**

```
Create a detailed user flow diagram for parking spot reporting:

SCENARIO: User parks car and reports it
START: User opens app
STEPS:
1. App loads map with current location
2. User finds parking spot
3. User taps floating "Report" button
4. Modal appears with two options
5. User taps "I Parked Here"
6. Confirmation animation appears
7. Spot appears on map for all users
8. User receives +10 points notification

Include decision points, error states (no GPS, no network), and alternative paths

```

**Prompt 4: Color Accessibility Check**

```
Evaluate this color scheme for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance):
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Primary: Blue (#2196F3)
- Success/Available: Green (#4CAF50)
- Warning/Medium: Yellow (#FFC107)
- Error/Occupied: Red (#F44336)
- Text: Dark Gray (#212121)

Check contrast ratios and suggest improvements for colorblind users (deuteranopia, protanopia)

```

- correctionCount: number of users who reported inaccuracy
- historicalPattern: average occupancy for this location/time (0-1)

LOGIC:
1. Base confidence: 95 for fresh reports
2. Time decay:
   - 0-30 min: no decay
   - 30-60 min: -20 points
   - 60-90 min: -25 points
   - 90+ min: -30 points
3. Correction penalty: -15 points per correction
4. Historical boost/penalty: ±10 points if pattern strong

  location: geohash or grid cell,
  hour: 0-23,
  dayOfWeek: 0-6,
  avgOccupancy: 0-1,
  sampleSize: integer,
  lastUpdated: timestamp
}

ALGORITHM:
1. Group reports by location (100m grid) + hour + day
2. Calculate rolling average occupancy
3. Weight recent data more heavily (exponential moving average)
4. Minimum sample size before trusting pattern (e.g., 20 reports)

QUERY:
Given current location and time, return expected occupancy

Provide pseudocode and discuss trade-offs between accuracy and storage

```

**Prompt 15: Zone Aggregation Logic**

```
Implement zone-level aggregation for parking availability:

INPUT: Array of individual spots with confidence scores
OUTPUT: Zone-level summary "3-5 spots likely available in this area"

ALGORITHM:
1. Group spots by 100m radius circles (use H3 geohashing)
2. For each zone, calculate:
   - High confidence spots (85-100%): count as 1.0 available
   - Medium confidence (50-84%): count as 0.5 available
   - Low confidence (<50%): count as 0.2 available
3. Sum weighted availabilities
4. Express as range: floor(sum) to ceil(sum)

EDGE CASES:
- Zone with no reports: show "Unknown"
- Zone with only low confidence: "Possibly 1-2 spots"
- Zone with high confidence: "Definitely 3+ spots"

Provide implementation in JavaScript/TypeScript

```

**Prompt 16: Anomaly Detection**

```
Design anomaly detection system for parking patterns:

PURPOSE: Identify unusual parking situations worth alerting users

ANOMALIES TO DETECT:
1. Unexpected availability: "Usually 90% full, today only 40%"
2. Sudden occupancy surge: "20 spots filled in 10 minutes"
3. Conflicting reports: Multiple users report different statuses
4. Suspicious patterns: Same user reports parking/leaving rapidly

APPROACH:
- Use rolling averages and standard deviations
- Z-score for statistical significance
- Threshold for alerting (e.g., 2 standard deviations)

OUTPUT:
- Alert type and severity
- Suggested user notification
- Data for dashboard

Provide statistical model and implementation pseudocode

```

## XIV. HACKATHON-SPECIFIC PROMPT TEMPLATES

**Template 1: "I'm Stuck"**

```
I'm stuck on [specific problem] in my hackathon project.

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
- [attempt 1] - resulted in [error/issue]
- [attempt 2] - resulted in [error/issue]

CURRENT CODE:
[paste relevant code]

ERROR MESSAGE:
[paste error if applicable]

CONSTRAINTS:
- Limited time remaining ([X] hours)
- Need this working for demo at [time]
- Can't change [existing component] due to dependencies

Help me debug this or suggest a simpler alternative approach that will work for the demo.

```

**Template 2: "Make It Demo-Ready"**

```
I have this working feature but it's not polished enough for demo:

[describe current state]

ISSUES:
- [problem 1: e.g., UI is ugly]
- [problem 2: e.g., no error handling]
- [problem 3: e.g., slow performance]

TIME AVAILABLE: [X] hours
PRIORITY: Looking good > perfect functionality

Suggest quick improvements that have maximum visual impact with minimum time investment. What's the "MVP polish" I should focus on?

```

**Template 3: "Last-Minute Pivot"**

```
We need to pivot due to [technical blocker/time constraint].

ORIGINAL PLAN: [what you were building]
BLOCKER: [why it's not working]
TIME LEFT: [X] hours

ASSETS WE HAVE:
- [working component 1]
- [working component 2]
- [data/resources available]

Suggest a pivot strategy that:
1. Salvages existing work
2. Is achievable in remaining time
3. Still demonstrates core innovation
4. Makes sense in our pitch narrative

Provide step-by-step plan for remaining hours.

```

**REMEMBER:** AI is a tool, not a crutch. Use prompts to:

- ✅ Accelerate routine coding
- ✅ Generate boilerplate
- ✅ Debug faster
- ✅ Learn new patterns
- ❌ Don't blindly copy without understanding
- ❌ Don't skip testing AI-generated code
- ❌ Don't let AI make architectural decisions without team input

# üßπ Cleanup Reminder: Remove Claude Branch

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Your code is clean!** All your commits on the `claude/migrate-from-replit-011CUTmrxJM9PQ7K8XsSbMXz` branch are authored by **khue** (no Claude attribution).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Branch name** contains "claude/" prefix (required by the system for now).

## Local `main` Branch Status

I've created a **clean local `main` branch** with:
- ‚úÖ **Contributors:** khue + hduong612001 (your previous work)
- ‚úÖ **NO Claude attribution** in any commits
- ‚úÖ **NO Replit attribution** in recent commits (only in old hduong612001 commits from when you worked on Replit)
- ‚úÖ All migration work + in-memory storage

**Note:** The local `main` couldn't be force-pushed to GitHub (branch protection), but it exists locally and is ready to use!

## How to Clean Up Later (When Ready to Deploy/Share)

### Option 1: Merge via Pull Request (Recommended)

1. **On GitHub**, create a Pull Request from `claude/migrate-from-replit-011CUTmrxJM9PQ7K8XsSbMXz` to `main`
2. **Merge the PR** (this will update main with your clean commits)
3. **Delete the `claude/*` branch** on GitHub after merge
4. **Locally:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -D claude/migrate-from-replit-011CUTmrxJM9PQ7K8XsSbMXz
   ```

### Option 2: Force Update Main (If You Have Admin Access)

```bash
# Switch to clean local main
git checkout main

# Force push to GitHub (requires admin rights or disabled branch protection)
git push --force origin main

# Delete the claude/* branch
git push origin --delete claude/migrate-from-replit-011CUTmrxJM9PQ7K8XsSbMXz

# Clean up locally
git branch -D claude/migrate-from-replit-011CUTmrxJM9PQ7K8XsSbMXz
```

### Option 3: Work on New Clean Branch

```bash
# Switch to local clean main
git checkout main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Work on your feature
# ... make changes ...

# Push (you can push any branch except protected ones)
git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature
```

**For now:** Keep working on the `claude/*` branch. Your commits are attributed to **you** (khue), which is what matters on GitHub!

**Later:** When you're ready to deploy or share the repo, follow one of the cleanup options above.
